The createLattice function uses fractal Brownian motion (fBm) to generate the lattice structure. It applies a multi-layered Perlin noise algorithm to create a 5-dimensional lattice. The noise is generated using the fBm technique, which combines multiple layers of Perlin noise at different frequencies and amplitudes to create a more complex and natural-looking pattern.

The resulting lattice is a 5-dimensional grid, where each cell contains a LatticeSymbol object. The LatticeSymbol structure holds information about the symbol, colors, shades, and complexity of that particular cell in the lattice.

The fBm algorithm is a common technique used in procedural generation to create realistic and diverse patterns. It is often used to generate terrain, textures, and other natural or organic structures. In this case, it is being used to generate the lattice structure for encryption purposes.
